# Pick Up From Last Session

## Purpose

Resume work from a previous session by reading the most recent handoff file. Provides context summary and next steps so you can continue seamlessly. Pairs with `/handoff`.

## Variables

HANDOFF_ARG: $ARGUMENTS
HANDOFF_DIR: specs/handoffs/

## Instructions

- Default: Load the most recent handoff (highest number)
- If a number is provided, load that specific handoff
- If "list" is provided, show all available handoffs
- Present information in a clear, actionable format

## Workflow

1. **Check for handoffs folder**
   - If `specs/handoffs/` doesn't exist, inform user no handoffs found

2. **Parse argument**
   - Empty → Load most recent (highest numbered) handoff
   - Number (e.g., "2" or "002") → Load that specific handoff
   - "list" → Show all available handoffs

3. **Find handoff file**
   - List all files in `specs/handoffs/`
   - Sort by number prefix (001, 002, 003...)
   - Select appropriate file based on argument

4. **Read and present**
   - Read the handoff file
   - Present in the summary format below

5. **Offer next steps**
   - Based on handoff content, suggest where to start
